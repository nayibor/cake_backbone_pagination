#What is this 

This repository is for a demonstration of using backbone.js and underscore templates to create pagination on the client side.
Getting data can be done using any server side framework(cakephp,laravel,phoenix,zend) but cakephp was used as server side example . 
The paginate_info folder contains
 
* ProductController.ctp which contains the controller file which was made using cakephp
* paginate_models.js contains the backbone model data
* paginate_template.ctp contains the backbone template for pagination
